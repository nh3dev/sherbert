# Free Ammonia Foundation

This is the official website of the **Free Ammonia Foundation** (FAF) --
a community of enthusiasts in everything to do with computers or
~unserious~ engineering. We create, game and talk nonsense. It's a
small, tightly knit and partially guarded community which lends its self
to nice, _real_ interaction. You can become a part of _Nh3_ too!

## Community
Currently there are a few ways to join us, such as
[Discord](https://discord.gg/f5FVgr7gxX) (where you can get a feel for
what the **Free Ammonia Foundation** is about -- we would love for you to
pop in, discuss, chat, and become part of our little corner of the internet!
For finding out more, check out the [/Community](/community) page, it has
all the info you need regarding mailing lists.
