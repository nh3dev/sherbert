# **Free Ammonia Foundation**

This is the official website of the **Free Ammonia Foundation** (**FAF**) --
a community of enthusiasts in everything to do with computers or
~unserious~ engineering. We create, game and talk nonsense. It's a
small, tightly knit and partially guarded group which lends itself
to nice, *real* interaction. You can become a part of **nh3** too!

## Community
Currently there are a few ways to join us, such as
[Discord](https://discord.gg/f5FVgr7gxX) (where you can get a feel for
what the **Free Ammonia Foundation** is about -- we would love for you to
pop in, discuss, chat, and become part of our little corner of the internet!

## Projects
Our flagship project is [shard](/projects/shard) -- a simple, pragmatic, 
and non opinionated functional flavoured imperative language.
Have a peek! And if it is something you'd like, why not contribute?

For more information on all of the **nh3** projects, see the [/projects](/projects) page.

## Membership
Membership is *free* ~as in libre~ -- it will only cost you some effort.  
There is no regular standard application process, by joining and actively
being a part of the community, your willingness to join is *implicit*,
and its more valuable than filling out a silly form. If you are a part of
the community, and we get the right kind of vibes, *we* will extend you an
invitation to officially join us.

Membership means you get a few cool perks:
- brand new, shiny `@nh3.dev` email with a username of your choice
- access to create git repositories under `github.com/nh3dev`
- ability to add new blog posts to our [/blog](/blog) page
- member role on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/f5FVgr7gxX)
