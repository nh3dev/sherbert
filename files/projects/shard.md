**Shard** - "The OSR of programming languages" *~~is this even a good quote?~~*

</div>

[github](https://github.com/nh3dev/sharc)&nbsp; 
[docs](shard-docs)&nbsp; 
[examples](shard-examples)

## Premise
Simple, pragmatic, and non-opinionated functional flavoured imperative language.  
<!-- more cool things -->

```
// pretty average language :p
let average = |a: &[u32]|: u32 {
	loop let (sum, i) = (0, 0) {
		if i == a.len: break sum;
		(sum + a[i], i + 1)
	} / a.len
};
```

## Features
- Types as first class values, with insanely powerful type inference.
- All the things you'd expect in a modern language like: generic types, fat pointers, explicit mutability, etc.
- Clojure like threading macros, allowing for a method-chain like syntax.  
  (I cannot believe *ALL* languages dont have this, its just so useful)
- Compiling to llvm IR, making it decently fast and platform agnostic out of the box.
- Linear type system and minimal move semantics.
- Pattern matching, and destructuring. Pretty much Rust with few confusing syntaxes removed.
- Shark mascot! (best of all the features) ~~if you wanna draw a full ascii version lmk~~

## Non-Features
- We arent planning on making a package manager or build system for shard.  
  Although this might change in the future if the need arises.

## FAQ
- When are you gonna release? ... :( Yeah we're kinda starved for people to work on it..  
  Please help out if you can! (join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/f5FVgr7gxX) for more info)
- Where's the old shard? This is a new project. I realized the old one was.. not *very* useful.
  Don't get me wrong, I'd love to see it done in the future, but I decided to take a more pragmatic direction towards the dev.  
  One day we might also make **Phase** as a companion project, but that is a long way off.
- Who's working on this? Check [the repo](https://github.com/nh3dev/sharc) for up to date info.  
  Currently its mostly me + bullying others into helping.
