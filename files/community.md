Most people prefer to join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/f5FVgr7gxX), and it is where
most ~unserious~ development and discussions occur -- but note that actual changes and
technical discussions occur via the mailing lists.
Either way, we welcome you in with open arms!

## Mailing lists

There are currently two mailing lists: `patch` and `dev`. The `patch` mailing list
is for the sending and discussion of patches and contributions. The purpouse of
`dev` is for anything else: bug reports, feature requests, general discussion on the
usage of software ect.

Note that, unlike the [Discord](https://discord.gg/f5FVgr7gxX), mailing lists are
moderated (to prevent things like spamming all of our emails). This means that,
until you have are an NH3 member, your posts will be individually reviewed before
reaching the list users. We hope to be quick in this, but our community is mostly
european so expect longer delays the further you are from us timezone wise.
For more information regarding membership, see the [/Membership](/membership) page.

Both `patch` and `dev` are configured to respond to certain commands which
you can send (e.g `patch+help@nh3.dev`, the subject and content is irrelevant).
A description of these commands can be found below:
